/**
 * WS14: Recipe runner.
 *
 * Orchestrates the full lifecycle of a recipe execution:
 *   1. Resolve recipe by name
 *   2. Flatten includes (with cycle detection)
 *   3. Substitute inputs into the goal
 *   4. Set env vars
 *   5. Invoke the agent via the provided executor
 *
 * The runner is deliberately thin: it does NOT own the agent runtime.
 * Callers supply a `RecipeExecutor` function that receives a resolved goal
 * and session config. This makes the runner trivially testable with a mock.
