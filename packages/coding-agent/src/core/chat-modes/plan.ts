/**
 * Plan mode (Gap 2 of cave-v2 agent harness wire-up).
 *
 * Read-only exploration mode. The model sees only file-discovery tools and
 * produces a written plan. The user reviews the plan and types `/act` to flip
 * back into the normal `edit` mode where the agent can mutate files.
 *
 * Cave is autopilot — there is no permission dialog. The mode flip is the
 * approval gate. Plan mode also drops the gating system prompt suffix so the
 * model knows exactly what to produce.
