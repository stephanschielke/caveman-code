/**
 * WS8: editor-side formats for the architect/editor split.
 *
 * In `editor-diff` / `editor-whole`, the architect (planning) model emits
 * a high-level natural-language plan; a downstream editor model translates
 * the plan into concrete file edits using either `diff` or `whole`.
 *
 * The split lets us route reasoning to a high-end model and dispatch the
 * mechanical translation to a cheap, fast one. Aider reports +5–10pp pass@1
 * on its bench by pairing GPT-4 architect + Claude 3 Opus editor.
