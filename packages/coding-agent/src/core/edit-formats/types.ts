/**
 * WS8: Edit-format interface.
 *
 * Edit formats describe HOW the model emits file modifications.
 * Each format defines a system-prompt fragment teaching the model the wire
 * format, plus a parser that extracts file edits from the assistant's reply.
 *
 * Formats (Aider's taxonomy):
 *   - whole          send the entire new file content
 *   - diff           SEARCH/REPLACE blocks with file fences (Aider's default)
 *   - diff-fenced    SEARCH/REPLACE inside a single fenced block (gemini-style)
 *   - udiff          unified diff hunks
 *   - editor-diff    architect/editor split — editor runs `diff`
 *   - editor-whole   architect/editor split — editor runs `whole`
 *
 * Provenance: shape + nomenclature mirror Aider's edit formats. Aider is
 * Apache-2.0 — we cite the algorithm + adapt for cave's tool-call model.
